ZoomToRectBug is a simple demo Application for both iPhone & iPad.
It demonstrates a bug which occurs when using the UIScrollView in conjunction with the "zoomToRect" method.
The bug occurs when the size of the contentView.frame is smaller than the UIScrollView.frame and the  "zoomToRect" method is called for a second time. The first time is zooms to the correct scale and the content offset is {0,0}, the second time the zoom scale is the correct but the content jumps, it is offset to the right and to the bottom.
